Learning golang while practicing with the [Udemy course by Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/)

- Concurrency with Channels and Go routines


The code files are more or less self contained short snippets of code, written to reinforce the ideas learnt during the lessons. They can be run simply as: 

`$ go run <file name>`

Some directories might contain code exercises related to certain topics such as file I/O etc and might have unit tests written in separate <name>_test.go files.
They can be simply run by running go test in that directory:

`$ go test`
